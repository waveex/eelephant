          thrilled
          to present this collaboration and the LJUV collection, and we hope that you can see, feel, use the connection
          between a designer from the Middle East democratic design.

          Nada Debs is a Levantine designer living and working in Beirut. Her work spans scale and discipline: from
          product to furniture design to one-off commission across craft, art, fashion, and interiors. Nada grew up in
          Japan, studied design in Rhode Island School of Design in the US, and has spent significant periods living and
          traveling the world, finding connections of each of her experiences in all her work. She calls her approach
          handmade, and heart-made</p>
